/******
 * useStableFunction.ts
 *
 * This is a custom React hook that creates a stable function reference that
 * does not change on every render.
 *
 * @param fn - The function to be stabilized.
 * @returns A stable version of the provided function.
 *
 * This hook is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary
 * re-renders or re-executions of functions in React components, specifically
 * when passing functions as props to child components or when using them in
 * dependencies of other hooks, to avoid unnecessary re-renders or
 * re-executions.
 *
 * It uses a ref to store the latest version of the function and a callback to call it.
 *
 *      Example usage:
 *      const stableFunction = useStableFunction((arg1, arg2) => {
 *          // Your function logic here
 *       })
